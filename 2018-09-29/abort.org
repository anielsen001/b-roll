The Dayton Daily News published an [[https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/ohio-sees-increase-abortions-report-says/nctwyeXcLzsZkDGm3X6wdN/][article]] discussing the trend of abortions in Ohio. I found
the article hard to follow because only raw numbers were published and the only context 
referred to political considerations as opposed to getting into the details of what's 
really going on. The numbers in the DDN article actually came from this [[https://www.odh.ohio.gov/-/media/ODH/ASSETS/Files/health-statistics---vital-stats/Induced-Abortions-in-Ohio-2017.pdf?la=en
][Ohio Department of Health report]] 

These are the numbers from the Dayton Daily News article

The Dayton Daily News published an [[https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/ohio-sees-increase-abortions-report-says/nctwyeXcLzsZkDGm3X6wdN/][article]] discussing the trend of abortions in Ohio. The linked 
article does not have the same headlines nor include the table from the print version, so I took a picture of it and put it
here. Crucially the subheading says:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

The numbers presented don't show the full 10 year trend referenced in the article. 
The numbers in the DDN article actually came from this [[https://www.odh.ohio.gov/-/media/ODH/ASSETS/Files/health-statistics---vital-stats/Induced-Abortions-in-Ohio-2017.pdf?la=en][Ohio Department of Health report]],
which includes more detailed information over a longer period of time. So I plotted back
to 2006. There is clearly a dip and rise again from 2010-2012. The size of this
exceeds the 2017 rise substantially, making one wonder what trend the author
of the DDN article sees that is being bucked. In addition to totals, the report
also breaks out numbers for Ohio residents which I also included.

What was also missing in particular from the DDN article was any discussion of the size of Ohio's 
overall poplulation relative to the report abortion numbers. For example, the report increase
might actually be a decrease if the change in population size is accounted for. I obtained 
[[https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/demo/popest/nation-total.html#par_textimage_401631162][numbers from the US Census]] and computed totals per 100,000 people.

Plotted this way, it appears the increase from 2016 to 2107 is only 0.3%, not the 1% 
mentioned in the article.

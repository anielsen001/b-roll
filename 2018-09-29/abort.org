The Dayton Daily News published an [[https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/ohio-sees-increase-abortions-report-says/nctwyeXcLzsZkDGm3X6wdN/][article]] discussing the trend of abortions in Ohio. The linked 
article does not include the table from the print version.

I found
the article hard to follow because only raw numbers were published and the only context 
referred to political considerations as opposed to getting into the details of what's 
really going on. The numbers in the DDN article actually came from this [[https://www.odh.ohio.gov/-/media/ODH/ASSETS/Files/health-statistics---vital-stats/Induced-Abortions-in-Ohio-2017.pdf?la=en][Ohio Department of Health report]],
which includes more detailed information over a longer period of time. 

What was missing in particular from the DDN article was any discussion of the size of Ohio's 
overall poplulation relative to the report abortion numbers. For example, the report increase
might actually be a decrease if the change in population size is accounted for.

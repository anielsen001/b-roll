An article appeared in the Dayton Daily News (DDN) about 
teacher misconduct which included this figure:

The information in the figure came from this Ohio Department of 
Education [[http://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Teaching/Educator-Conduct/Educator-Conduct-Data/State-Board-Annual-Report-2017.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US][report]]. (The report shows a similar figure on pages 13.)

A quick examination of the chart reveals that the numbers do not 
appear to add up. I.e. the total number of cases does not equal
the number of cases resulting in discipline or no discipline.
At first glance this appears to be a significant issue. I made
my own version of the plot, adding a sum that represents the 
"Discipline" + "No Discipline" numbers.

Reading through the article, one finds that the number of cases
resulting in a decision are not necessarily the same cases
that were opened that year because sometimes cases take a while
to resolve.

However, the most important fact to note from the OH DOE report
is that 77% of these cases come from people applying for a 
teaching license, not people who are actually teachers since
the department investigates people applying for teaching credentials
as well as current teachers referred to for misconduct. It's also
important to note that the number of applicants increased and if 
you normalize the number of cases opened by the number of applications
you get a very different picture.

which looks like the number of cases being investigated is driven
more by the increasing number of applicants, not some broader
problem with teachers.
